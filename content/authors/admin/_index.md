I graduated from the National Autonomous University of Mexico in 1998 with a BSc in Veterinary Medicine. I worked as a Veterinary Surgeon in Mexico until 2007 with a particular interest in zoonotic diseases. In 2008, I graduated from the University of East Anglia with an MSc in Environmental Sciences. In 2013, I obtained a PhD in Climate Change and Human Health from the University of East Anglia. My PhD thesis focused on the role of climate and climate change on the risk of dengue transmission in Mexico.

From 2012-2015, I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy investigating the effects of climatic, environmental and socioeconomic factors on malaria transmission in Eastern Africa. I also worked with the Ministries of Health of Uganda and Rwanda in the development of a high-resolution, malaria forecasting system. I participated in several FP7 Consortia (QWECI, Healthy Futures, Responses) providing technical expertise on statistical disease modelling. From 2015 to Jan 2019, I was a Senior Research Associate at the University of East Anglia working on the development of statistical and machine learning decision support tools for syndromic surveillance in England. My work has influenced how syndromic surveillance is conducted in England. I have worked with Public Health England in several Health Protection Research Units providing expertise in statistical disease modelling. I am a Research Fellow at the School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia.
